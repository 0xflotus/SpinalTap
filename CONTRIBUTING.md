### General Guideline
- Please fork this repository (https://github.com/airbnb/SpinalTap) and make changes on the fork.
- Please include corresponding unit/functional/integration tests if you are committing a non-trivial change.
- Please run the `gradle spotlessApply` in the root directory to follow the code style.
- Please do NOT change any public APIs without discussing with the team.
- Please follow the `Design Template` to document the new feature design, and send a PR for review.

### Design Template
- Motivation
  [Discuss the existing pain points and the advantages will get through the new features.]
- Public Interface
  [Discuss what are the changes on the public APIs (newly added, deprecated, and deleted APIs).]
- Proposed Changes
  [Discuss in details about the proposed changes.]
- Compatibility, Deprecation, and Migration Plan
  [Discuss the potential compatibility issues and any migration process we need to follow if there is any.]
